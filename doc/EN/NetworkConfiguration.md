# Network Configuration

![ansible](../../img/ansible.png)


1. The ip address configured in the `inventory.ini` configuration file is the intranet ip, and the master computer and the target computer are in the same intranet for the sake of network interoperability.

2. Extranet ip needs to be configured for via and carrier, with via_external_ip configured as the via extranet ip and carrier_external_ip as the carrier extranet ip.

3. Service port information
